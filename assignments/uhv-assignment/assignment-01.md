A harmonious life means living in continuous happiness and mutual prosperity, without contradiction within oneself, in relationships, society, and nature.

According to Universal Human Values, harmony is achieved through:

- Right Understanding

These are the essential activities of the Self (I).

### **Right Understanding**

Right Understanding means understanding reality as it is particularly:

- The co-existence of Self and Body
- Harmony in relationships
- Harmony in society
- Harmony in nature and existence

It develops through self-exploration, self-awareness, and self-evaluation.

### Role of Right Understanding

1. Differentiating between:

   - Need and greed
   - Self and body
2. Establishing clarity in:
   - Values
   - Priorities
   - Life goals
3. Removing:
   - Confusion
   - Blind beliefs
   - Imitation and comparison

### **Resolution**

Resolution is a firm decision in the Self to live according to right understanding.

It means commitment to:

- Right feelings

Resolution converts understanding into practice.

## Q 3. Human being is the co- existence of the body and self. Comment.

According to Universal Human Values, a human being is not merely a physical body. A human being is the co-existence of the Self (I) and the Body.

- The Self (I) is the conscious entity.
- The Body is the physical entity.
- Both exist together and function in coordination.

Thus, human existence is a combination of consciousness and material structure.

**The Body**

- It is a physical structure made of material elements. - It grows, ages, and decays.
- It performs physical activities like walking, eating, sleeping.
- It needs physical facilities (food, clothing, shelter).

The body is an instrument.

**The Self (I)**

- It is the conscious unit.
- It performs activities such as:
- Desire
- Thought
- Expectation
- Selection
- Imagination
- Understanding

The Self is the decision-maker and experiencer.

Basis of Harmony or Contradiction

**Harmony occurs when:**

- The Self understands the needs of the body.
- Physical needs are regulated.
- Desires are evaluated through right understanding.

**Contradiction occurs when:**

- Body is mistaken as the Self.
- Unlimited physical desires dominate.
- Temporary pleasures are treated as happiness.

Proper coordination between the two leads to harmony and continuous happiness, while confusion between them leads to contradiction and human problems.

Thus, recognizing this co-existence is fundamental for achieving a holistic and harmonious life.

## Q4. Describe the four levels of harmony (individual, family, society and nature) and their importance in solving human problems.

Universal Human Values explains that human problems arise due to lack of harmony at different levels of existence.

### **Harmony must be ensured at four levels:**

1. Individual (Self)
2. Family
3. Society
4. Nature

When harmony exists at all four levels, an All-encompassing Resolution is achieved, leading to a peaceful and sustainable life.

### **First Level: Harmony at the Individual Level**

(Harmony within the Self)

The human being is the co-existence of Self (I) and Body.

**Harmony at individual level means:**

- Understanding the difference between Self and Body
- Balance between desires, thoughts, and expectations
- Right understanding in the Self
- Physical health of the body

**Importance:**
Individual harmony is the foundation. Without inner clarity, harmony at other levels is impossible.

### **Second Level: Harmony in Family**

(Harmony in Relationships)

Family is the basic unit of society.

**Harmony in family means:**

- Mutual trust
- Respect
- Affection
- Care
- Guidance

**Importance:**
Family harmony provides emotional security and stability.

### **Third Level: Harmony in Society**

(Harmony in the Larger Human Order)

Society consists of many families working together.

**Harmony in society includes:**

- Justice
- Equality
- Cooperation
- Mutual prosperity
- Fearlessness

**Importance:**
Social harmony ensures peaceful coexistence and collective progress.

### **Fourth Level: Harmony with Nature**

(Harmony in the Natural Order)

**Harmony with nature means:**

- Sustainable use of resources
- Avoiding exploitation
- Understanding co-existence

**Importance:** Nature provides all physical facilities. Without ecological harmony, survival itself becomes difficult.

### Role in Solving Human Problems

Most human problems today (violence, stress, inequality, pollution) arise due to lack of harmony at these levels.

By ensuring:

- Right understanding at individual level
- Right relationships in family
- Justice and cooperation in society - Sustainable living with nature

We achieve:

- Continuous happiness
- Mutual prosperity
- Social stability
- Environmental sustainability
