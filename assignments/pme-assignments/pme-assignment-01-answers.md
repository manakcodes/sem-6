### **Q-9: Compare and analyze the Symbolic and Omnipotent views of Management.** (7 marks)

Compare and Analyze the Symbolic and Omnipotent Views of Management

The effectiveness of management in an organization can be explained through two major perspectives: the Omnipotent View of Management and the Symbolic View of Management. These views differ in terms of the level of control managers have over organizational outcomes.

**Omnipotent View of Management**  
The Omnipotent View assumes that managers are all-powerful and directly responsible for the success or failure of an organization.

- Managers have complete control over organizational resources and decisions.

- Failures are attributed to poor managerial decisions or ineffective leadership.

- It emphasizes the importance of managerial skills, experience, and strategic thinking.

**Merits of Omnipotent View**  
Encourages managers to take initiative and responsibility.

Promotes innovation, leadership, and proactive decision-making.

**Limitation**  
Ignores the impact of external environmental forces such as economic conditions and government policies.

**Symbolic View of Management**
The Symbolic View suggests that managers have limited influence over organizational outcomes due to external constraints.

- Success or failure is often beyond managerial control and is influenced by market conditions and uncertainty.

- Organizational culture, traditions, and values play a major role.

- Managers mainly provide direction, support, and motivation.

**Merits of Symbolic View**  
Recognizes the importance of the external environment. - Provides a realistic view of managerial limitations.

**Limitation**  
May reduce managerial accountability and responsibility.

**Analysis and Conclusion**  
In practice, neither view alone fully explains organizational performance. While managers influence outcomes through decisions and leadership, external environmental factors also play a critical role. Therefore, a balanced approach combining both the omnipotent and symbolic views provides a more accurate understanding of management effectiveness.

### **Q-12 Explain Management as a Science, Art and Profession.**

Management as a Science, Art and Profession

Management is a dynamic and comprehensive discipline that cannot be explained from a single perspective. It is best understood by analyzing management as a science, an art, and a profession, each highlighting a different aspect of managerial practice.

**Management as a Science**  
Management is considered a science because it is based on systematic knowledge, principles, and theories developed through observation and experimentation.

- These principles help in predicting outcomes and solving organizational problems.

- It follows a cause-and-effect relationship, such as planning leading to goal achievement.

- Scientific methods like analysis, forecasting, and decision-making are used.

**Limitation**  
Management principles are not as exact as physical sciences due to human behavior variability.

**Management as an Art**  
Management is also an art because it involves the application of knowledge and skills to achieve desired results.

- It requires personal skills, creativity, and judgment.

- Experience plays a vital role in improving managerial effectiveness.

- Successful management depends on how well a manager applies knowledge in real-life situations.

**Limitation**  
Art alone is insufficient without the scientific knowledge base of management.

**Management as a Profession**  
Management is increasingly viewed as a profession due to its specialized knowledge and ethical standards.

- Professional managers follow codes of conduct and ethical guidelines.

- Managers are accountable to society, organizations, and stakeholders.

- Continuous learning and development are emphasized.

**Limitation**  
Unlike traditional professions, management does not have mandatory licensing.

**Conclusion**  
Management cannot be classified exclusively as a science, art, or profession. It is a combination of all three, where scientific principles guide decisions, artistic skills ensure effective implementation, and professional standards maintain ethics and responsibility. This integrated approach makes management a unique and essential discipline.
